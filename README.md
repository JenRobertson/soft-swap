## How to play

Swap the toys by clicking with the mouse until you make a line of 3 or more. The toys will then disappear and you will get points.

Swapping a bomb will destroy 6 around it and stars will destroy a whole line.

## How I made it

* Made using vanilla javascript and HTML canvas only.
* Graphics made using Adobe Illustrator, exported as SVGs.
* No libraries or modules of any kind used.
